Installation process of anaconda and jupyter: 

Go to the Anaconda Downloads page and download the 64-Bit Graphical Installer for Mac.

Double click on the .pkg file and click Install.
Read and agree to the licensing terms.
Select if you want to install for ‘Just Me’ or ‘All Users’. If you are installing for ‘All Users’, you must have 4. Administrator privileges.
You will be prompted to select the installation location. By default, Anaconda should try to install in your home directory. We recommend accepting this default. Click Install.
You will be asked if you want to add Anaconda to your PATH environment variable. Do not add Anaconda to the PATH because it can interfere with other software.
You will be asked if you want Anaconda to be your default version of Python. We recommend ‘Yes’. There are some rare instances where you would not make Anaconda the default version, but they are beyond the scope of this article.
Click the Install button.
You may be asked if you want to install PyCharm. PyCharm is another IDE (similar to Jupyter Notebook) but is not necessary right now.
Go ahead and finish the installation.
Now you can verify your installation. Go to your Applications folder and double-click on Anaconda Navigator.
Now we need to install a few key packages. In the BASH or zsh terminal, type:

conda install jupyter

Once the installation completes, in the BASH or zsh terminal, type:

jupyter notebook
A Jupyter Notebook interface will appear in your default browser.
When prompted with ‘Proceed ([y]/n)?’ type y.
